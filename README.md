# Advent Calendar

#### _Epicodus - Android Week 4, 12.13.2016_

#### By Sheena Nickerson & Stephen Emery

This original idea for this project was to create an Advent calendar Android app where users can perform different gestures on the Christmas gifts to enjoy different sounds or animations. Currently, only the elf and ribbon have touch listeners attached. Try double tapping, flinging or long pressing on the elf to see what happens!
